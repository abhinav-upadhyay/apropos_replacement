.Sh NAME
.Nm makemandb
.Nd Parse the man pages and build mandb.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl flo
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility traverses the list of directories containing man pages, parses them 
with the help of libmandoc and builds an Sqlite database apropos.db to support 
full text searches. It obtains this list of directories using the 
.Op Fl p
option of 
.Xr man 1
Its options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl f
Force rebuilding the index from scratch, pruning the existing one.
.It Fl l
Limit the parsing to only the NAME section of the pages. This option 
can be used to mimic the behaviour of the classic
.Xr apropos 1
and also save disk space substantially.
.It Fl o
Use this option to optimize the index so that the search is fast and also 
it drops the disk space usage significantly, but this is a somewhat expensive 
operation.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width /etc/apropos.db -compact
.Pa /etc/apropos.db
The Sqlite FTS database which maintains an index of the manual pages.

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
at the moment is unable to parse the escape sequences in
.Xr man 7 
pages, which should be fixed in upcoming versions.
