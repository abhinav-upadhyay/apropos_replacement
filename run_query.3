.Dt RUN_QUERY 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm run_query
.Nd run a query against
.Pa /var/db/man.db
and process the results in a callback function.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In apropos-utils.h
.Ft int
.Fn run_query "sqlite3 *db" "const char **snippet_args" "query_args *args"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn run_query
function prepares the user supplied query in a form suitable to be run
against
.Pa /var/db/man.db
and executes the query.
For each row obtained in the result set,
.Fn run_query
will call the user supplied callback function, which should contain the
logic for processing the data thus obtained.
.Pp
The
.Fn run_query
function takes following arguments:
.Bl -tag -width 8n
.It Fa sqlite3 *db
Handle to the database connection which can be obtained by calling
.Fn init_db .
.It Fa const char *snippet_args
An array of strings which specify the
delimiters to the matching text in snippet.
It is an optional argument and caller can supply a
.Dv NULL
value for it, in which case, a default value of
.Brq \&"\&", \&"\&", \&"...\&"
will be used.
The 3 members of the array specify the following values:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
The first element marks the beginning of each matching token in the snippet.
.It
The second element the end of each matching token in the snippet.
.It
The third element is used to delimit the beginning and end of the snippet.
.El
For example for highlighting matching tokens in HTML style mark-up, use this
value:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
 const char **snippet_args = {
	"<b>",
	"</b>",
	"..."
 };
.Ed
.It Fa query_args *args
.Ft query_args
is a struct which is defined in
.Pa apropos-utils.h .
It has the following fields:
.Bl -tag -width 8n -offset indent
.It Li const char *search_str
This is the query as entered by the user.
You may want to pre-process it to do sanitization etc.
.It Li const char **sec_nums
This is an array of
.Ft char *
wherein each index element represents the
section number in which search should be performed.
The sections whose corresponding index element in this array is set to
.Dv NULL
are not searched.
If all the elements in the array are
.Dv NULL
then all the sections are searched. 
Alternatively pass
.Dv NULL
as the value of this element to search in all the sections.
.It Li int nrec
This specifies the number of matching rows to fetch from the database.
.It Li int offset
This specifies the offset within the result-set. Use it to specify the position
from where to start processing the result-set.
For example if the value of nrec is m and value of offset is n, then the first 
n records from the result-set will be omitted and rest m-n (or less) records will
be available for processing inside the callback.
.It Li int (*callback) (void *, int, char **, char **)
This is the callback function which will
be called for each row retrieved from the database.
The function should return a value of 0 on successful execution.
A non-zero return value will indicate a failure and
.Fn run_query
will return.
The interface of the callback function is described later in this section.
.It Li void *callback_data
Use this argument to pass any data to the callback function.
It can be retrieved inside the callback function from its first argument.
.It Li char **errmsg
If an error occurs while fetching the data from the database,
a human readable error message will be stored in
.Fa errmsg .
If no error occurs then
.Fa errmsg
will be set to
.Dv NULL .
In case
.Fa errmsg
is not
.Dv NULL ,
then the caller should make sure to free it.
.El
.El
.Pp
The interface of the callback function is
.Ft int
.Fn (*callback) "void *callback_data" "int ncol" "char **col_values" "char **col_names" .
.Pp
Its arguments are:
.Bl -column -offset indent "Function" "Argument Description"
.It Li void *callback_data Ta This is the caller supplied data.
.It Li int ncol Ta Ta \&It represents the number of columns in the result set.
.It Li char **col_values Ta This is an array of strings, where each index element
represents the value of the correspondingly indexed column in the result set.
.It Li char **col_names Ta This array stores the name of the columns whose values
have been fetched from the database.
.El
The query which
.Fn run_query
results in a 5 column result set.
Those are as follows:
.Bl -column -offset indent "Column Name" "Column Description"
.It Li section Ta The section number of the page.
.It Li name Ta The name of the page.
.It Li snippet Ta The snippet of the matching text in the page.
.It Li name_desc Ta The one line description from the NAME section.
.It Li rank Ta A double value indicating rank/weight of the page.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful execution the
.Fn run_query
function will return 0 and in case of an error \-1 will be returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width /var/db/man.db -compact
.It Pa /var/db/man.db
The Sqlite FTS database which contains an index of the manual pages.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Following is a code excerpt of how
.Pa apropos.c
uses
.Fn run_query .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <apropos-utils.h>
query_args args;
char *errmsg = NULL;
const char **sec_nums = {NULL, "2", "3", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL};
args.search_str = argv[1];
args.sec_nums = sec_nums;
args.nrec = 10;
args.callback = &query_callback;
args.callback_data = NULL;
args.errmsg = &errmsg;
if (run_query(db, NULL, &args) < 0)
		errx(EXIT_FAILURE, "%s", errmsg);
}

free(query);
free(errmsg);

static int
query_callback(void *data, int ncol, char **col_values, char **col_names)
{
	char *section = col_values[0];
	char *name = col_values[1];
	char *snippet = col_values[2];
	char *name_desc = col_values[3];
	/* The user supplied data could be obtained as follows */
//	 my_data *buf = (my_data *) data;

	fprintf(stdout, "%s(%s)\t%s\en%s\en\en", name, section, name_desc,
	snippet);
	return 0;
}
