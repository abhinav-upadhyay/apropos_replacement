.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In apropos-utils.h
.Ft int
.Fn run_query_html "sqlite3 *db" "query_args *args"

but with the following three differences.
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It Li
.Nm
takes only two arguments.
.It Li
The result set returned by
.Nm
contains one new column, the ordering of the columns in the result set is same
as in
.Xr run_query 3 .
This new column has the name html_result and appears as the last column of
the result set.
It combines the complete result in a logical form enclosed between <p> and </p> 
tags.
.It Li
The snippet returned by
.Nm
uses <b> and </b> tags to highlight the matching pieces of text so that it 
appears bold in a web browser.
.El
For more details, refer to the manual page of
.Xr run_query 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful execution the
.Fn run_query_html
function will return 0 and in case of an error \-1 will be returned.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -hang -width -compact
.It Pa /var/db/man.db
The Sqlite FTS database which contains an index of the manual pages.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Following is a code excerpt of how
.Nm
can be used.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <apropos-utils.h>
query_args args;
char *errmsg = NULL;
const char **sec_nums = {NULL, "2", "3", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL};
args.search_str = argv[1];
args.sec_nums = sec_nums;
args.nrec = 10;
args.callback = &query_callback;
args.callback_data = NULL;
args.errmsg = &errmsg;
if (run_query(db, &args) < 0)
		errx(EXIT_FAILURE, "%s", errmsg);
}

free(query);
free(errmsg);

static int
query_callback(void *data, int ncol, char **col_values, char **col_names)
{
	char *html_result = col_values[ncol - 1];
	fprintf(stdout, "%s\en", html_result);
	return 0;
